## Preparing for development

1. Make sure you have [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) installed. We use it to pull the RxNimble dependency for development.
2. Check out this repository.
3. Do a `carthage update --platform ios --no-use-binaries`
4. Open `RxNimble.xcodeproj` and start hacking!
